Title: Loglikelihood Adjustments for Econometric Models
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Date: 2021-03-17
Description: Adjusts the loglikelihood of common econometric models for
    clustered data based on the estimation process suggested in 
    Chandler and Bate (2007) <doi:10.1093/biomet/asm015>, using the 'chandwich' 
    package <https://cran.r-project.org/package=chandwich>, and provides 
    convenience functions for inference on the adjusted models.
