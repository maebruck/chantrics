\title{Predict Method for chantrics fits}
\usage{
\method{predict}{chantrics}(object, newdata = NULL, type = c("response", "link"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Object of class \code{chantrics}, as returned by \code{\link[=adj_loglik]{adj_loglik()}}}

\item{newdata}{optionally, a data frame in which to look for variables with
which to predict. If omitted, the fitted linear predictors are used.
Supplying new data is currently not supported.}

\item{type}{the type of prediction required. The default \code{"response"} is on
the scale of the response variables. The alternative \code{"link"} is on the
scale of the linear predictors, if applicable, otherwise, an error is
returned.}

\item{...}{unused.}
}
\value{
A vector of predictions.
}
\description{
Obtains predictions from chantrics objects. The function can currently only
supply predictions of the \code{link} and the \code{response} values of the data used
for the fit.
}
\details{
If \code{newdata} is omitted, the predictions are based on the data used
for the fit. Any instances of \code{NA} will return \code{NA}.
}
